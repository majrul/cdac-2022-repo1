- To check the version of git installation:
git --version

- To learn Git, first create one folder somewhere on your filesystem
and on the shell/terminal/command prompt, go inside that folder using:
cd folder-path/name

- Next let's create one file inside this folder, for ex:
hello.txt. For ex if you want to open notepad, you can type:
notepad hello.txt

- Now to start using git, the first thing we need to do is create a repository:
git init

- Next we need to add the hello.txt file to the staging area of Git by using:
git add hello.txt

- After this, we need to commit the changes by using:
git commit -m "my first commit"

- Practice modifying an existing file, adding and committing it
- Practice creating another file, adding and committing it

- Then to check the commit history:
git log

- We can go and see the content of the file in any previous commit by typing:
git checkout commit-id (copy commit id from git log)

CAUTION: please don't do any changes by going back in time as of now, just view the state of the files and come out

- To come back to the current timeline:
git checkout main/master


- Now we will see how to push the files from the local repository to a remote repository like Github

- First we need to login to Github and create a new repository
  - Create a blank repository and public initially
  - You will get the URL for accessing the repository, make a note of it
  - Also we need to go to Developer settings and generate a personal access token for logging into our Github account from anywhere

- Back on the Command Prompt, we will link the remote repository with the local one by typing:
git remote add myremoterepo http://github.com/....

- Then to push the files from local to remote, we need to type:
git push myremoterepo main/master
